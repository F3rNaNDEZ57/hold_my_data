# Properties of a Sound Wave

1. **Frequency (f)**:
    
    - Measured in **Hertz (Hz)**.
    - Refers to the number of complete wave cycles per second.
    - Determines the pitch of the sound. Higher frequency corresponds to higher pitch and vice versa.
2. **Amplitude (A)**:
    
    - The maximum displacement from the equilibrium position.
    - Determines the loudness or intensity of the sound. Higher amplitude corresponds to louder sound and vice versa.
3. **Wavelength (Î»)**:
    
    - Distance between two consecutive similar points (e.g., from crest to crest or trough to trough) of a wave.
    - Inversely proportional to frequency for a given speed of sound.
4. **Velocity (v)**:
    
    - Speed of the sound wave.
    - In air, sound typically travels at about **343 meters per second (m/s)** at room temperature.
5. **Phase**:
    
    - Refers to any point in a wave cycle relative to its starting point. Two waves are said to be "in phase" if they start and finish their cycles at the same time and "out of phase" if they do not.
6. **Timbre (quality)**:
    
    - The characteristic that allows us to distinguish between two sounds of the same pitch, loudness, and duration. It is determined by the harmonic content of a sound and its envelope.
7. **Compression and Rarefaction**:
    
    - A sound wave consists of compressions (where particles are close together) and rarefactions (where particles are spread apart).
